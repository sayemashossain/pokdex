# Pokedex In Progress

## What I used

### Stack

- Vite-React-Typescript project
- D3 to fetch and parse data from csv

### Data

- data `pokemon.csv` from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon)
- pokemon images from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types)
- type images from [bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Type)

## Inspiration

- [Nindhya Azzahra - Pokedex](https://codepen.io/meowrow/pen/xxmOLJw)
- [Mauro E. Wernly - Pokedex Animation](https://dribbble.com/shots/9240064-Pokedex-animation)
